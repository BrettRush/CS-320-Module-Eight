To ensure the functionality and security of code, programs, or software, several key practices must be followed. Thorough testing involves conducting unit, integration, and system tests to find and fix bugs. Using proper error handling and validation mechanisms helps mitigate risks and ensure proper operation. Security measures such as input validation, data encryption, and access controls must also be used to protect against potential cyber-attacks. Adhering to user needs is crucial for developing software that meets requirements. This involves engaging with users through surveys, interviews, and feedback sessions to gather requirements. Documenting these requirements helps prioritize features that align with user expectations.
